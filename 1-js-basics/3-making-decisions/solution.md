# challenge subtask 3 part 1
## if... else function
`` let biggest;
let num=123;
let another=234;
let third=345;
if(third > num && third > another){
    biggest=third;
}else{
    biggest="another number";
}
console.log(`biggest numbeer is ${biggest}`);``

## ternary expression
`` let number=123;
let another=234;
let third=345;
let biggest=third>number && third>another?console.log("${third} is the biggest") : console.log("${third} is not the biggest");``

my prefered syntax would be ternary if it is a expression with two conditions and if it contains more than one condition then i would prefer if else function.

# challenge subtask 3 part 1
## if... else function
`` let biggest;<br>
let num=123;<br>
let another=234;<br>
let third=345;<br>
if(third > num && third > another){<br>
    biggest=third;<br>
}else{<br>
    biggest="another number";<br>
}<br>
console.log(`biggest numbeer is ${biggest}`);<br>``

## ternary expression
`` let number=123;<br>
let another=234;<br>
let third=345;<br>
let biggest=third>number && third>another?console.log("${third} is the biggest") : console.log("${third} is not the biggest");<br>``

my prefered syntax would be ternary if it is a expression with two conditions and if it contains more than one condition then i would prefer if else function.
